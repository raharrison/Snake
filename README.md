# Snake

An implementation of the classic game Snake in C#.

The aim of the game is to get the highest score possible by directing the head of the snake to the yellow food placed randomly around the playing area.
As the food is eaten, the snake grows by five blocks which makes it harder to control.

The game is over when the head of the snake hits any of the four walls or any part of it's body.
